First ever attempt at building a desktop MacOS app. It includes a backtester UI using a predefined market-structure based strategy which you can tweak the parameters for. 
Upon running the backtest, you can click on the positions and investigate the candles where it took place. 
Was a great introduction also to creating applications for arm64 and x86. 
Admittedly, code is not the cleanest, but it served its learning purpose.
